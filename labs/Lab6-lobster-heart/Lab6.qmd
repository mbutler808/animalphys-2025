# Before Lab

This will be our first invertebrate lab. We will be studying the control of the neurogenic heart of crustaceans using the lobster as a model.

:::{.callout-note}
# Prepare for lab by:
- Read the lab manual for this weekʻs experiment \[[Lab 6](Lab6-lobster-heart.pdf)\] exploring the physiology of the toad heart using ECG and a force transducer.  
- Write the \[[Prelab](../../labs-misc/lab-notebook.qmd#sec-prelab)\] in your lab notebook. 
  + For the __Intro__, focus on identifying the physiological mechanisms (outline them), and end with a paragraph of hypotheses/expectations (like the worksheet).
  + Think about __strong hypotheses__! _Strong hypotheses lead to excellent reports._
  + __Methods__: subjects, experimental methods and analyses (how you will compare to address the hypotheses -- _you should start thinking about how you will plot the data for the results to make these answers pop_). 
- Do prelab Quiz on Laulima (open 24 hrs before lab). 
- Please check out the \[[powerpoint notes](../../powerpoints/Lab6.HeartControlLobster.pdf)\] and the review paper on the \[[crustacean cardiac ganglion](Cooke02.pdf)\] by our very own Dr. Ian Cooke who was an emeritus faculty from the Zoology Department and PBRC, a pioneer in invertebrate neurophysiology!

## In Lab: 

- _Plan to Work quickly!_ __You will have 30 min (and very lucky if you have an hour)__ once you open the carapace. 
- Keep your animal chilled (they are Maine lobsters!) and irrigated with ice-cold Lobster ringers at all times.
- Lab 6 manual \[[pdf](Lab6-lobster-heart.pdf)\] . Record data in your lab notebook. 
- You should have plenty of time to complete the data collection and your figures during lab.  
- This will be a Group Lab. Begin planning with your partners as you work. 
- Start an outline with your lab partners and start outlining your discussion points, and the rest of the report. Use your time wisely to brainstorm as you work.

## After Lab: 

- Group lab report due next week. See the guidance at the end of the \[[Lobster Heart lab manual](Lab6-lobster-heart.pdf)\]. You may also want to look over the guidance at the end of the \[[Toad Heart Lab](../Lab5-toad-heart/Lab5-toad-heart.pdf)\].  
- Always follow the content guidelines: \[[grading guidelines](../../labs-misc/handouts/Zool430lab_report_guidelines.pdf)\]
- It is a good idea to divide up the work of writing the lab __by experiment__. That way, _each person writes a portion of the intro, methods, results, and discussion for their __hypothesis___. 
- Work out your timeline with your lab partners during lab (and plan a face-to-face meet up [hey! you can do your lab EC]) _so that everyone has a chance to comment and edit_ before the lab is submitted.
