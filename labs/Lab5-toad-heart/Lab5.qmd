# Before Lab

:::{.callout-note}
# Prepare for lab by:
- This will be our first dissection lab. Itʻs really cool!
- __Wear shoes to lab__, and bring your dissecting kit (if you have one, otherwise we have supplies). Lab coat is not required but you are welcome to wear one if you wish. 
- Read the lab manual for this weekʻs experiment \[[Lab 5](Lab5-toad-heart.pdf)\] exploring the physiology of the toad heart using ECG and a force transducer.  
- Write the \[[Prelab](../../labs-misc/lab-notebook.qmd#sec-prelab)\] in your lab notebook.
- Do Quiz on Laulima (open 24 hrs before lab). 
:::


## In Lab: 

- Lab 5 manual \[[pdf](Lab5-toad-heart.pdf)\] \[[docx](Lab5-toad-heart.docx)\]. Record data in your lab notebook. Use the guidance at the end of the lab manual to analyze your data in preparation for your results and discussion. 
-  Dissection guide \[[pdf](DissectionGuide.pdf)\]
- Toad heart anatomy. Note that amphibians have a 3-chambered heart! Two atria and one ventricle. \[[pdf](HeartAnatomy.pdf)\]

## After Lab: 

- Individual Work Sheet due next week \[[pdf](Lab5IWS-toad-heart.pdf)\] \[[docx](Lab5IWS-toad-heart.docx)\]
- You will include statements of purpose (section 1), concept check (section) 2), mini results (section 3), and a regular discussion. On this lab WS, put a little more effort into the discussion.  For each section we ask for, always follow the content guidelines: \[[grading guidelines](../../labs-misc/handouts/Zool430lab_report_guidelines.pdf)\]
-  You are encouraged to analyze data with your lab members, and may develop figures together, but all writing must be your own work.
