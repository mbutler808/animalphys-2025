- __Come prepared__ by __reading the book__, and our discussions can __probe deeper.__ This will make your __homeworks__, __labs__, and __papers__ so much easier. 
- __Remember that effort counts__, and will be taken into account in the final grades. If your grade is on the borderline, effort will translates into a "bump up".  You show effort in many ways, including attendance and sincere participation.
