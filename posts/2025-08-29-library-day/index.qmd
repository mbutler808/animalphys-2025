# Goals for today 

::: {.callout-note}
## Get a strong foundation for your design project

1.  With your partner, explore background on potential animals
2.  Search for books that will help with the [*Animal Design Project Background*](../../projects/0.BackgroundDesign.pdf)
3.  Check out at least 5 books that may be helpful. Itʻs free!
4.  With your partner, [Select a fossil](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ltSJWU8k0LD_U0ZnFzrzyZ_fQGIj6aJ1Sxnmrx0a4Ek/edit?usp=sharing) or at least get some ideas about type of animal youʻd like to work on. 
5.  Today is just an introduction, you will need to accumulate more information.

# Explore Library Resources 

### Where do we find information?


___General Background___ is best found in __BOOKS__.
Academic books are the best source for things that are well-known or have been known for a long time. Here you will find general information about the habitat at the time (paleontology books), the general biology of that kind of animal (e.g. herpetology, mammology, or mammalian paleontology, etc. ).

:::{.callout-tip}
# Some Very helpful books  
- __General books__ on Vertebrate Paleontology, Mammalian Paleontology, Fishes, etc. These will have info on the time period, environment, habitat, lifestyle, etc. 
- Books on the -ology (extant biology) of your animal. Mammology, Ornithology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, etc.
- Physiology of fishes, Avian physiology, etc.    
:::

__Compilations__ can be found in __REVIEW ARTICLES__  
Academic authors will sometimes write a summary of the last 10 years or so of reasearch in a review article. These are often found in Annual Reviews as well as other places. If one exists for your group, get it. 

__Newest Information__ can be found in __JOURNAL ARTICLES__. 
Scientific articles report the latest findings at that moment in time.
