# Pre-class materials 

::: callout-note
## Read ahead

**Before class, you can prepare by reading the following materials:**

1. Tuesday we will finish Muscle Discussion and move on to biomechanics and locomotion
2. Thursday we will continue locomotion.
3. Lab this week is on \[[human EMG](../../labs/Lab8-human-emg/Lab8.qmd)\]! Pay attention to refining your prelab.
