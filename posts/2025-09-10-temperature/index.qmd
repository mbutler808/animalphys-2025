# Pre-class materials 

::: callout-note
## Read ahead

**Before class, you can prepare by reading the following materials:**

1. Withers chapter 5. Look over the homework, handout, and discussion questions and skim the chapter, reading anything that you need to know. 
2. \[[Discussion Questions](../../discussions/Discussion-Week3-temperature.pdf)\] 
3. \[[Slide Deck](../../powerpoints/3.Temperature.pdf)\] - for your reference as we go through the material
:::

### Announcements/Reminders

-  We are back in the lab this week. Read \[[Lab 3](../../labs/Lab3-human-peripheral-circulation-dive-response/Lab3.qmd)\]. Watch the podcast on peripheral circulation. Read Do prelab quiz and the prelab, focusing on the hypotheses that you will design. 
-  We will finish Metabolism and begin Temperature. 
-  HW1 due Tuesday in class, hand-written (you may submit as a group - week 2 if you wish). 
-  HW2 due next Tuesday in class (individual).

# Thought for the day

> Physiology is the story of evolutionâ€™s struggle to maintain an appropriate SA/D ratio in relation to the volume of an animal -- _Haldane_

# 3. Temperature

## Modes of Heat Transfer

- __Conduction__
- __Convection__
- __Evaporative__
- __Radiative__

Animals also generate heat through __Metabolism__.

{{< video https://youtu.be/BHchDrboqEo >}}



Flux = C * $\nabla$ (Mass or Energy) 

Q = C * M $\nabla$ T

Where:
- Flux is the transfer of mass or energy
- $\nabla$ is the gradient symbol
- Q is heat
- C is a material property (resistance or insulation value)
- T is temperature

## Heat Balance 

Metbolic heat production is balanced by all mechanisms for heat exchange: 

$\Delta$H$_s$ = H$_m$ $\pm$ H$_c$ $\pm$ H$_r$ $\pm$ H$_e$

Where:  
$\Delta$H$_s$ = heat of storage  
H$_m$ = heat of metabolism  
H$_c$ = heat of conduction and convection  
H$_r$ = heat of radiation  
H$_e$ = heat of evaporation  

If an animal is in heat balance, Tb (body temperature) is stable. 

If $\Delta$H$_s$ is positive,  (Gains > Losses), then  Tb increases.  

If $\Delta$H$_s$ is negative,  (Gains < Losses), then  Tb decreases.

# For Next Time

1. \[[HW2](../../homework/HW2heat_temp.pdf)\] due on Tuesday in class. (Individual)
2. Finish temperature, begin \[[Cardiac Function](../../discussions/Discussion-Week4-heart-function.pdf)\]
3. Start working on design 1 calculations with your partner. See me for help \[[Office hours](https://calendly.com/mbutler808/office-hours)\]
4. Next Lab: \[[Human ECG](../../labs/Lab4-human-ecg)\]
5. Please fill out the TEAMMATES for both discussion week 3 and Lab 2 group lab by MONDAY. (check your email)
