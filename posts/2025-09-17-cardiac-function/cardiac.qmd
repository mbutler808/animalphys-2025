This week we will learn more about cardiac morphology, function, and regulation. There are multiple very short (but important) readings, and some longer readings to skim. Don ªt worry about understanding every detail in the readings, but rather look over the discussion questions first and hunt through the readings for those topics, skimming over the rest. _These are going to be important topics for the next few labs._ 

# Pre-class materials
