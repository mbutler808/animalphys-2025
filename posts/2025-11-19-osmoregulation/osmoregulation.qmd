# Pre-class materials 


::: callout-note
## Read ahead

**Before class, you can prepare by reading the following materials:**

1. Tuesday we will finish respiration and Thursday begin osmoregulation. 
2. The Symmorphosis paper is a very interesting and important paper. It will be useful for design3 respiration. 
3. In Lab this week you will measure your own brain waves using EEG. Have fun! \[[manual](../../labs/Lab11-human-eeg/Lab11.qmd)\]!

# Tuesday - 

## Aquatic Respiration, Fish Gills

- __Reading assignment:__ Withers Aquatic respiration: skim 565-72, read 573-4, 585-99, supplement
12-2. ALTERNATIVELY, read HWA chapter 22 + HWA 586-587 (countercurr) + HWA 590-594 (fish).
- \[[discussion pg 3, Q4-5](../../discussions/Discussion-Week10-blood-ventilation.pdf)\] \[[slide deck](../../powerpoints/10a.Blood.pdf)\] \[[slide deck2](../../powerpoints/10b.Ventilation.pdf)\]
- __Topics:__
  - Partial pressures of gasses and pO2 at sea level - the starting point. 
    + Influences of relative humidity
    + Altitude (total pressure) 
    + Henry ªs Law - dissolved O2 in water
  - Flow patterns: Countercurrent vs. Concurrent
  - Fish Gills 
    + Ventilatory pumps in fish (breathing patterns) 
  - Root Effect

# Thursday - Symmorphosis
- __Reading assignment:__ Symmorphosis: Weibel, Taylor, and Hoppeler (1991) The concept of symmorphosis: A testable hypothesis of structure-function relationship. PNAS 88:10357-61 [Respiration Papers folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Td1DRJpE398Mj50m5r7bm4ooiinkchct/view?usp=share_link)
- In class discussion

## Begin Osmoregulation
- __Reading assignment:__ Withers skim beginning Ch. 16 for definitions in list below, also read Water & Ion Budgets pp. 788-790, Vertebrates pp. 798-803, Terrestrial Environments pp. 806-812, Terr. Verts. 822-827.  Withers is actually very readable on this topic, and some of it will be familiar to you already:).
- \[[discussion](../../discussions/Discussion-Week11-osmoregulation.pdf)\] \[[slide deck](../../powerpoints/11.Osmoregulation.pdf)\] \[[slide deck 2](../../powerpoints/11b.Osmoregulation_SaltWater.pdf)\]
- definitions: 
    -   solutes, 
    -   osmosis, 
    -   osmolarity/osmolality, 
    -   ionoregulation, 
    -   osmoregulation/osmoconforming, 
    -   compatible solutes, 
    -   perturbing solutes, 
    -   counteracting solutes, 
    -   osmotic permeability (&formulae)
- The components of __Water Budgets__ (input/output) as well as __Ion Budgets__
