# Pre-class materials 

::: callout-important
## Let ªs finish strong!

- We have __only 3__ class sessions left to finish all of our content. After that, we have final student presentations. 
- __Attendance is mandatory__ at all remaining classes. 
- __Come prepared__ by __reading the book__, and our discussions can __probe deeper.__ This will make your __homeworks__, __labs__, and __papers__ so much easier. 
- __Remember that effort counts__, and will be taken into account in the final grades. If your grade is on the borderline, effort will translates into a "bump up".  You show effort in many ways, including attendance and sincere participation.

### Announcements/Reminders

-  Due Monday Design 3 draft \[[turn in](../../projects/design3-turnin.qmd)\], please do your peer review for design 3 by wednesday, and email to the authors with cc to me.
-  TEAMMATES will be on hold and Tuesday's session will be combined with the week after Thanksgiving :). 
-  The EEG group lab is due at midnight by email to your TA on your lab day. No lab sessions this week.
-  Short week this week, happy Thanksgiving!!

## Tuesday 
- __Reading assignment:__ Withers skim beginning Ch. 16 for definitions in list below, also read Water & Ion Budgets pp. 788-790, Vertebrates pp. 798-803, Terrestrial Environments pp. 806-812, Terr. Verts. 822-827.  Withers is actually very readable on this topic, and some of it will be familiar to you already:).
- \[[Osmoregulation discussion](../../discussions/Discussion-Week11-osmoregulation.pdf)\] \[[slide deck](../../powerpoints/11.Osmoregulation.pdf)\] 
- definitions: 
    -   solutes, 
    -   osmosis, 
    -   osmolarity/osmolality, 
    -   ionoregulation, 
    -   osmoregulation/osmoconforming, 
    -   compatible solutes, 
    -   perturbing solutes, 
    -   counteracting solutes, 
    -   osmotic permeability (&formulae)
- The components of __Water Budgets__ (input/output) as well as __Ion Budgets__
- The water and ion challenges of __freshwater__, __marine__, and __terrestrial__ environments

-  If there is time, start \[[Excretion questions 1,2](../../discussions/Discussion-Week11b-excretion.pdf)\] \[[slide deck 2](../../powerpoints/11b.Osmoregulation_SaltWater.pdf)\] which we will finish next week. 

- Be prepared to diagram and discuss the routes of water and ion inflow and outflow for terrestrial animals (human), freshwater fish (q1), marine fish (q2), and marine elasmobrachs (q3).
  + This time, start with the osmotic gradient facing the animal. Clearly label the mOsm of the media outside, as well as mOsm inside (use the extracellular fluid as the inside compartment).   
  + Consider the gradient facing the skin :) also. 
  + Label special organs or sites of major exchange.
  + Indicate __water__ and __ions__ separately, and whether it is active or passive movement, and for ions - which ones (details matter).
  + __Look in your book!__
- For excretion think about nitrogenous waste (osmoreg question 5) and what mechanisms organisms have for their excretion (excretion questions 1,2)

## Thursday - Happy Thanksgiving!!!

# Coming up Next Week

- We will pick up Excretion the Tuesday after Thanksgiving \[[questions 3](../../discussions/Discussion-Week11b-excretion.pdf)\] \[[slide deck 2](../../powerpoints/11b.Osmoregulation_SaltWater.pdf)\] and have a fascinating discussion on reptile and bird excretion \[[notes](../../discussions/11c.Avian_Reptilian_Osmoregulation_Notes.pdf)\]
