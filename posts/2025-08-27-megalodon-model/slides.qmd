### Design Project 
Together with your partner, you will choose an [extinct vertebrate]{style="color: blue"} to study.  

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%" .incremental}

- Background Research: 
  + Create a strong foundation for modeling your animalʻs biology and physiology
- Design Projects:  
  + Activity budget, metabolism and heat balance. 
  + Diet and digestion
  + Respiration
  + Osmoregulation and excretion
- How could your animal have met its environmental and physiological challenges? ___How did it live?___

## Learning by doing —- Project Based {.scrollable}

::: {.incremental}
- __Readings__ at home
- In-Class __Discussion__ to flesh out ideas and push
- __Homeworks__ challenge us to use the information
  + _Calculations prepare us for the Design Projects_
- Building on the shoulders of giants 
  + _Gathering background for best assumptions_
- __Short papers__ allow us to create new knowledge
  + _Oral Presentations test “work in progress”_
- Peer and Instructor __Reviews__ to hone work
- __Final Draft__ - Voila!

## Goals

- Creativity
- Accuracy
- Authority
- Repeatability
- Communication
  + Ease of dissemination to other researchers
  + [_Show me, don't tell me_]{style="color: blue"}

## Useful Mindsets {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- Demand Excellence
- Criticism helps us to improve
- Developing a thick skin makes it easier!
- Learning is a developmental process - [_UNCOMFORTABLE_]{style="color: red"}
- Science is collaborative - [Respect]{style="color: red"}
- Thinking is improved through _reflection and revision_
- __Effort and Attitude Counts — a LOT !!!__
- Science is creative
- Mastery will prepare you for life
