<!---- ### Compact and Cancellous Bone

Bone structure is fascinating. As organisms get larger, bones provide structural support. But bones also grow and remodel, as well as provide bone marrow for the development of blood cells.  

The structural part is generally in the __compact bone__. The __cancellous__ bone is the spongy interior and in the joints.

# Explore Library Resources 

### Where do we find information?


___General Background___ is best found in __BOOKS__.
Academic books are the best source for things that are well-known or have been known for a long time. Here you will find general information about the habitat at the time (paleontology books), the general biology of that kind of animal (e.g. herpetology, mammology, or mammalian paleontology, etc. ). [Get all the books you can in Hamilton for a strong foundation.]{style="color: blue"} 

__Compilations__ can be found in __REVIEW ARTICLES__  
Academic authors will sometimes write a summary of the last 10 years or so of reasearch in a review article. These are often found in Annual Reviews as well as other places. If one exists for your group, get it. 

__Newest Information__ can be found in __JOURNAL ARTICLES__. 
Scientific articles report the latest findings at that moment in time. 


# For Next Time
