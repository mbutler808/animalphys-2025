# Turn in your Design 1 

1) Please be sure to __name the file using the naming convention FirstAuthorLastName_SecondAuthorLastName.pdf__ so that your peers can find the correct paper to review. Be sure to put the first author first.

For example: "_Hasegawa_Kondo.pdf_"

2) Post your draft paper on the shared Google Drive by 5pm Monday. \[[Upload here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZDvNTCNeE2OKg6W_fqvj6BQmo3GTcdOo?usp=sharing)\]

3) Post your final draft by midnight on Tuesday 10/1 \[[Upload here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17jxQxSR74Q_qeiy3JkIO8B5CgkUdHwFz?usp=sharing)\]

## Complete your Peer Critique

# Reference materials
- Find your \[[Review assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxPHKpWziRN4CuYmdeVSgQqSpMFQgJ8KG4GJDLqmdzM/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\] 
- Download your assigned manuscript. \[[Design 1 google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZDvNTCNeE2OKg6W_fqvj6BQmo3GTcdOo?usp=sharing)\].
- \[[Design 1 assignment](design1.qmd)\] 

__Print out the manuscript so that you can write comments directly on the report.__
:::

### _Read through the \[[content guidelines](PeerCritiqueGuidelines.pdf)\]_. 
 
### _Read your assigned manuscript. Be a good colleague._ 
- Your main task is to __critique the content__ - please go through their __analysis__ and look for any big improvements that could help. _Catch any errors, and they will be __extremely grateful__._ 
- As you go, mark it with brief comments or corrections. _Please do not correct each instance of the same type of error. Just point it out the first time._ 
-  __Focus on improvements__ that would provide the __biggest payoff__. Be explict
it (of course, don't be mean – just state the facts). 
-  When you receive your critique, it really helps to have a thick skin – we are working together to help each other produce the best final draft possible. 

### _Prepare your ~2 page __written critique__ for the authors_. 

  + __Begin your review with a positive statement__ before going into problems.  A critique is mostly negative – that's just the nature of the beast. As scientists, we are most interested in knowing exactly what is wrong, poorly stated, or unconvincing _so that we can correct it_. But it makes the medicine a little easier to swallow if you start with something nice.

  + Write __Major (overall) comments__ (about one paragraph). What were the major problems? The most significant shortcomings? Was it well-written and clearly organized?

  + Write __Specific comments__. For ideas on what to include for these sections, see Peer Critique guidelines:
    *  Content (specific comments on each section)
    *  Organization and Structure
    *  Style and Grammar
    *  Cited References

  + In general, pick the most significant comments to write up first. _You are not obligated to provide more than two pages_ (i.e., don't correcting every little thing, just point out on the first instance, and let the authors learn from finding the rest). 

  + Evaluate __Effectiveness of Collaboration__. Did each partner contribute significantly and more or less equally? (can be as short as one sentence, but please elaborate if you need to).

  + Focus on __specific comments related to content__. However, if there are problems in other areas, please tell them clearly. 

### _Assign a numeric grade based on a 100% maximum scale._ 
It should be weighted (approximately) 60% Content, 20% Organization & Structure, 10% Style and Grammar, and 10% Cited References. 

__The grade you give will not affect their grade at all. But will help clarify for everyone how papers are evaluated.__ Help them get a better grade by being clear so that the final version can be as strong as possible. 

__Your peer-review grade (10 pts)__ will be based on the __quality of your critique__, including the reasonableness of the grade you assign.

### Bring to LAB 
__One marked up copy of the paper__ for the authors, and __3 copies of your peer review__: one each to the two coauthors and myself. (To your colleagues to help them revise their paper and to me to grade your peer review.)

Thanks! Marguerite
