# Course Mechanics

## Course Methods:
We will learn science by practicing science.  

Students will learn physiology through assigned __readings__, will come to class prepared for productive __discussion__, practice scientific problem-solving by completing __homeworks__, and engage in __project-based learning__. Labs will reinforce learning through __experimentation__ and writing __lab reports__. 

As this is a writing and oral intensive course, we will learn by reviewing, editing, and rewriting your work as well as develop of effective scientific arguments through oral presentation.  Attendance is mandatory. 

## Scaffolding

- __Readings__ prepare you for _discussion_
- __Discussion__ is for trying out your ideas for _homework_ and _projects_
- __Homework__ is practice for the _design projects_
- __Oral presentations__ are for developing arguments for _design projects_
- __Peer review__ provides feedback on _design drafts_
- _Synthesize_ all your feedback into __design projects__

## Discussion

__Class time__ is mainly for interacting with the content through __discussion__. 
_Discussion is important for brainstorming and testing your explanations and getting feedback prior to your homework and design projects._ Read, ponder the study questions, and come to class prepared to engage in a high-level discussion in your discussion group of 3, assigned at random each week. 

__Grading__: Each week you will evaluate your discussion partners  (based on quality of contributions, preparation, participation). Each personʻs discussion grade is averaged from their partners. Thus in order to receive a grade, you must complete the evaluation yourself.  _Failure to attend = zero grade discussion grade._ Teaching staff can override grades for poor contribution at our discretion.

:::{.callout-tip}
## _Successful discussion requires a respectful attitude and collaborative behavior._ 
- [_Participation means Everyone must speak; everyone must listen_]{style="color: blue"} 
    + Take turns before diving deeper
    + Listen before contributing again
    + Take the time to make everyone feel comfortable
- Encourage participation from all — if someone is quiet, ___ask___ for their input/thoughts
- Respect cultural differences, do not judge people based on communication style
- Discussions are not about “scoring points” — they are about going deeper and getting creative. 
:::

## Problem Sets

Problem sets (homework) are designed to help you _master_ the lecture material AND to _prepare for the modeling calculations you will have to do in your animal design projects_. Problem sets are posted online and due in one week at the start of lecture.  
- __Everyone must do their own work__
- __Homeworks must be hand-written by yourself. Draw pictures by hand. On paper or by tablet is OK.__
- Come for help if you are stuck. 
- You may collaborate by working together — you may discuss strategies for solving the problems. [DO NOT ASK FOR OR GIVE OUT THE WORKED OUT ANSWER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.]{style="color: blue"} 
- Cheating or abuse of the honor system will result in big changes in the course and reporting to the Office of Judicial Affairs.

## Animal Design Project
The major project of this course. Work in a team of two to design four physiological systems of an extinct vertebrate animal: metabolism, digestion, respiration, and excretion (or your original design). (see @sec-design for details)



## Oral Presentations

You will present two 10 minute __oral presentations__ on your animal design: in week 5 during the lab session, and at the end of the semester in the lecture. Scientific talks are for receiving feedback on work in progress from the scientific community before their paper is finalized, so you are encouraged to speak on work in progress.

## Exams
No Exams in this class. No one makes a living taking tests.

## Guidelines for Group Work

Learning how to collaborate is an important life skill in today's world, but it is hard. [The point of collaboration is to produce of higher quality than what we can accomplish alone.]{style="color: blue"}

:::{.callout-tip} 
# Successful partners:
- Share a vision regarding the quality of work produced. 
- Have a clear plan of action _developed collaboratively_. 
- Stick to agreed schedule. 
- Will meet face to face or by zoom, etc.
- Share work equitably.
- Respect each other and their contributions. Are honest. 
- Communicate: Keep partners updated at all times.
- Complete work early enough to check each other's work and edit before handing it in.
- DO NOT partner with your best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc.  __Bad idea.__ 
- __Most, most, most important: Good partners do what they agreed to and get the job done on time.__  

[_Outstanding papers will be a unified product of both partners contributing their best efforts._]{style="color: blue"}
:::

We will see a wide range of papers in this class –  from what looks like last-minute work, to those that rise to the level of professional-quality. It is an amazing difference. 

## Software

__LabChart Reader Software:__ Install a free copy (reader version) of the data acquisition software to work on data analysis at home. Labchart 7.x or 8.x Reader:  <http://www.adinstruments.com/support/software>

Spreadsheet software is helpful for analyzing data and creating figures. __google sheets__, __excel__, __numbers__, or __LibreOffice__ are fine. 

[Optional] If you use R, let me know, and I can help. [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org).

### Project collaboration

Please feel free to study together and talk to one another about project assignments. The mutual instruction that students give each other is among the most valuable that can be achieved.

However, it is expected that **project assignments will be implemented and written up independently unless otherwise specified**. Specifically, please share strategies but not solutions, especially with folks who have not tried it yet themselves. 

Please __do collaborate__ on write-up and interpretation with your actual design partners or lab partners. Include all partners on all communications with instructional staff. 

## Discussion Forum

The course will make use of a [DISCORD server](https://discord.gg/RqZteFK2uq) to ask and answer questions and discuss any of the course materials. Please engage and provide answers as well as questions. The Instructor will monitor DISCORD and answer questions when appropriate.

# Animal Design Project {#sec-design}

Each pair of students will model four physiological systems and write a scientific paper describing the design for one of the physiological systems of an extinct vertebrate. See the [schedule](schedule.qmd) for due dates. Papers are written in drafts with opportunity to revise after receiving peer and instructor reviews. You will make 2 oral presentations.  One partner will be first author (have primary responsibility) for reports 1 and 3, and the other partner for reports 2 and 4. 

___Both authors are expected to contribute to the research and analysis presented as well as the writing___, but the primary author is responsible for coordinating the tasks, setting the schedule, submitting the initial draft, the final editing and submission of the final draft.

## Background Information

You will collect background information to inform your physiological model, and puzzle out how your animal could have solved its physiological challenges. 

### Information Sources
-  Your instructors, textbooks, books on organismal biology and paleontology in Hamilton Library, and the Internet are good places to start.  
-  References cited in your paper should be from the PRIMARY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE (i.e., __scientific books, review articles, and primary research articles from peer-reviewed professional scientific journals__). Books and journals for the general public are not acceptable. 
-  Use of websites are discouraged, only those maintained by research institutions (e.g., scientific museums) may be used. 
-  Caution!: DO NOT CITE CREATIONIST or POPULAR websites. Careful -- creationists create "institutes" too. 
-  Good websites for exploring potential fossils: 
    +  Tree of Life Project: <http://www.tolweb.org/tree/>
    +  Recent issues of [Nature](https://uhawaii-manoa.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9951085563805682&context=L&vid=01UHAWAII_MANOA:MANOA&lang=en&search_scope=DN_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=Everything&query=any,contains,nature) (especially) or [Science](https://www.science.org).

:::

## Format
- Papers must include a __Title__, an __Abstract__, __Introduction__, __Methods__, __Results__ (written in paragraph form and where you present your findings), __Discussion__ (discuss the implications of your results, what they mean and future directions), __Author Contributions__ (a brief paragraph describing what each person contributed to the paper), and __References__ (c.f. Kultz, 2003; min 10 primary literature sources). 
- The papers should be approximately 8 pages in length (1” margins on all sides, 12-point font double-spaced).  Figures and/or Tables are included in the page length, but References are not.   If possible, embed your figures into the text. Page limits are a target, I am more concerned about content rather than length. 
- Writing assistance @ the Manoa Writing Center (<http://www.english.hawaii.edu/writingcenter/>). _Or make an appointment to see me. I can help_. 

## Related Components 
- __Design background__  
- Four __Design Project__ papers. Clearly state your assumptions based on pertinent literature on the topic, as well as your own analysis and design of the system.  
- __Partner evaluation__. Each partner evaluates and grades the other’s contributions to the project.
- __Peer-reviews__/Grading.  Your review of a colleague’s design project paper. You will be assigned one paper to read at each due date. Turn in three copies of your written summary (the peer-review) and score that you feel the paper should receive (one copy to me, one to each of the authors). You will be graded on the quality of your peer-review and grading.

## Design Project Grading Criteria
The following are criteria for an “A” paper. Papers of lesser quality will be graded accordingly.

:::{.callout-tip}  
# The quality of the content is most important 
- The ___content (60%)___ is judged on mastery of the material and will demonstrate the following: 
    + Material presented is _accurate_ and _convincing_ (this means that your writing will give the reader will a high degree of confidence that you are correct and we can trust everything including your calculations); 
    + Deals _completely_ and _creatively_ with the physiological system in the assignment; 
    + _Major concepts_ are well _integrated_ demonstrating a thorough understanding on the part of the students;
    +  The paper reflects _university-level mastery_ of the material. 
    +  An “A” paper will provide a physiological insight into the problem 
- The ___organization (20%)___ is judged on the structure of the paper and will include: 
    + A clear and fully developed argument, 
    + Support for every claim/scientific statement via calculations and/or suitable references, 
    + A logical and concise overall organization, 
    + Paragraphs that are constructed to assist concise and orderly flow of ideas, 
    + Absence of repetition, and 
    + A varied range of sentence structure. 
- ___Style and grammar (10%)___: The paper should read smoothly and clearly, indicating the student’s ability to synthesize material from a number of sources into a coherent whole. There are no, or very few, typing errors. There are no significant errors in grammar, spelling or punctuation. 
- ___Cited references (10%)___ are of sufficient quantity and quality for the topic covered, and are appropriately cited and referenced. You may use any standard scientific format. [see for example](http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/DocCSE_NameYear.html)

_PLEASE NOTE: Your paper must be cohesive and interesting. Rubrics don’t convey the message that a poorly written paper will get lower marks on all categories_. 
:::



# Laboratory

## Laboratory Sessions
Labs meet once per week starting immediately. There will be [13 sessions](schedule.qmd) when experiments will be performed, one session for discussion of critiques of your animal design projects, and one session mid-semester when each team will deliver a 10-minute oral report on your animal design project.

## Laboratory Attendance
[__Attendance is mandatory and there are no make-up labs.__]{style="color: blue"} Failure to attend a lab will result in a grade of “zero” for that laboratory report unless you were absent due to health problems and have documentation from a doctor, clinic, or coroner stating why you were unable to attend class.  

If you are a UH athlete and are going to miss a laboratory due to an athletic event, you must inform your TA and Dr. Butler AT LEAST TWO WEEKS before that date.  In the case of acceptable absences, arrangements for alternate assignments will be made, as appropriate, and if feasible.

## Laboratory Materials
- Bound __laboratory notebook__ (composition book is fine)
 closed-toed shoes for labs involving dissection.  
- __Software:__ Install a free copy (reader version) of the data acquisition software to work on data analysis at home. Labchart 7.x or 8.x Reader:  <http://www.adinstruments.com/support/software>
- If you have a __dissection kit__, please bring it to dissection labs. 

## Pre-Lab
Prior to lab

1. Read the __lab manual__ and any __protocols__ with the aim of understanding the main question and techniques used, 
2. Do the prelab __quiz__ on Laulima, and 
3. Come with a completed __prelab__ written in your notebook, consisting of: __a brief introduction and a materials and methods section.__ Easy points! But no credit for late Pre-Labs.

## Laboratory Roles 
Laboratories will be conducted in groups of 3, with roles which rotate each week: 

1. __The animal handler/test subject__, who preps the subject, performs any dissection, and maintains the prep in good condition throughout the experiment 
2. __The experimenter__, responsible for all aspects of experimental setup and performing the manipulations, and scribe duties, and 
3. __The computer recorder__, who ensures that all data are recorded with annotations, and makes sure that the data are saved and distributed to all members. 
4. One of you will also be the __project coordinator__, which also rotates weekly

### Project Coordinator
The __project coordinator__ ensures that everyone knows their roles, works together efficiently and harmoniously, and checks data quality before moving on to the next procedure. They also  collaboratively establish writing assignments and deadlines. Like the producer on a movie set, the project coordinator is responsible for making everyone is doing their part to accomplishing the tasks. _Note: The PC does NOT do all of the analysis or writing._

_Each PC earns a “project coordinator score” based on the average score of the group lab reports for which he/she was project coordinator._

## Laboratory Reports
There will be a total of 13 laboratory reports: 

- 9 group reports (G), 
- 3 individual worksheets (IWS), and 
- 1 individual report (I) 
- These are designated G, IWS, or I on the [schedule](schedule.qmd)).
- _Lab reports are always due the following week at the start of your designated lab time_. 

Lab reports should be 3-5 pages in length; focus on the main ideas and get straight to the point. You can go longer if you can’t be more concise (donʻt just stop). Scientific content matters much more than style. 

## Fair Contributions to Group Work

- Group reports will be submitted by the Project Coordinator but __must have substantial contributions from each member of the group__.  
- Each collaborative report must have an official __“statement of respective contributions”__ section at the end of the report, detailing members contributions.
- Each group report submission will be followed by a __"Lab Partner Evaluation"__ which you will be invited to complete by an email from TEAMMATES. These are used to calculate your participation grade. 
- Please be honest and accountable, this is the path to improvement and success. 

## Lamaku shared course space

This course space is being shared by students in the following CRNs 
[76457, 77687] and if you do not wish to be in a shared course space, 
please drop this section and register for another section or alternate 
course.

# Grading

There will be a lot of points available for you to earn in the course.  As shown in the table below ~1/3 your grade will be based on points from lecture-based problem sets and discussions, ~1/3 from laboratory reports, and ~1/3 from the animal design project and oral presentation assignments.

# Course Policies

## Late work

- For both lab and lecture, we will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. We will deduct 5% for the assignment that is <24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.
- __Turn in ALL of your work,__ even if it is really late. [It shows effort]{style="color: blue"}.

## Tech-Related Course Policies and Expectations

- [_You are expected to do your own work:_]{style="color: blue"} reading assignments, research, and homeworks. 
- [_You are responsible for all of your work._]{style="color: blue"} If your name appears on the work, you are an author and are responsible for the work. _Make sure you approve everything that is turned in on your behalf_.
- _Any work submitted as your own must include proper crediting of all sources used._ This includes communication through any form of media, for example: in class, on the course website, or posted on Facebook. Do not “cut and paste” from text on posts or assignments without proper citation — this is cheating. 
- _Please do not multi-task during class._ This means no email, text, DM, social media, off-line conversations, sports scores, video games, etc. during class. _We can see you._ Laptops and mobile devices are allowed only for in-class activities. Abuse of devices may result in requiring devices to be turned in or being asked to leave the room.  
- You are required to use computers and the internet as part of this course. Technical difficulties are no excuse for unfinished work, there are computers in the library. If you have any issues please see me for help, UH has laptops for loan.
- _All assignments and postings are due on the dates indicated_ so that the class can proceed smoothly. Grading and feedback will be given within two weeks of submission date. 




## Academic Ethics and Student Conduct Code

The faculty, staff, and students participating in courses of the School of Life Sciences assume a responsibility to uphold the Universityʻs missions of academic excellence and social responsibility as appropriate for an institute of higher education. Violations of the UH Systemwide Student Conduct Code includes but is not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; providing copies of your work to other students which is submitted as their own; obtaining copies of said work by others; using copies of said work or representing any portion of another person’s work as your own (i.e., plagiarism); misconduct. While we encourage you to discuss strategies for problem solving,  and even collaborate by working through the problems/strategies together, giving someone all the answers is cheating. If you are unsure please ask.

__Plagiarism__ is when you use information or present ideas, whether by paraphrase or direct quote, from a source (be it published or a classmate) without giving proper credit to that source.
Cheating in any way will be reported to the attention of UH Office of Judicial Affairs, and result in an F in this course.
Students should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under the Systemwide Student Conduct Code [portal](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/proscribed_conduct.php).


## Disability Support Service

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you. Students requiring accommodations for disabilities should register with [the Kokua program at Student Disability Services](https://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). It is the responsibility of the student to register for accommodations. The Kokua office will send me a notification once you are registered, however, they often do not share information regarding the specifics. If the accommodations are not sufficient to ensure your success, please contact me as soon as possible so that we may work together on providing for an effective learning environment.
