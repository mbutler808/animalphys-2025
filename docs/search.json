Discussion is important for brainstorming and testing your explanations and getting feedback prior to your homework and design projects.

Each personʻs discussion grade is averaged from their partners. Thus in order to receive a grade, you must complete the evaluation yourself. Failure to attend = zero grade discussion grade. Teaching staff can override grades for poor contribution at our discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful discussion requires a respectful attitude and collaborative behavior.\n\n\n\n\nParticipation means Everyone must speak; everyone must listen\n\nTake turns before diving deeper\nListen before contributing again\nTake the time to make everyone feel comfortable\n\nEncourage participation from all — if someone is quiet, ask for their input/thoughts\nRespect cultural differences, do not judge people based on communication style\nDiscussions are not about “scoring points” — they are about going deeper and getting creative."

On paper or by tablet is OK. - Come for help if you are stuck. - You may collaborate by working together — you may discuss strategies for solving the problems. DO NOT ASK FOR OR GIVE OUT THE WORKED OUT ANSWER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. - Cheating or abuse of the honor system will result in big changes in the course and reporting to the Office of Judicial Affairs."

Are honest.\nCommunicate: Keep partners updated at all times.\nComplete work early enough to check each other’s work and edit before handing it in.\nDO NOT partner with your best friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc. Bad idea.\nMost, most, most important: Good partners do what they agreed to and get the job done on time.\n\nOutstanding papers will be a unified product of both partners contributing their best efforts.\n\n\nWe will see a wide range of papers in this class – from what looks like last-minute work, to those that rise to the level of professional-quality. It is an amazing difference."

    "text": "Suggestions and Tips\nIʻm hoping design 3 is your best effort so far. Iʻve said all this before, but hereʻs my suggested process to make that happen:\n\nGet help early!\nStart gathering your information, and take a first pass at making progress. Figure out whatʻs going to be hard, and come see me for help with anything you canʻt find or figure out. https://calendly.com/mbutler808/office-hours\n\n\n1. Lots of resources in the Shared Google Drive\n\n[Helpful index of papers] - Check it out!\nPapers are located in the Digestion folder of the [Shared Google Drive]\n\n\n\n2. Don’t forget to include page numbers!\n\n\n3. Process\n\nReview the assignment sheet (respiration or circulation) and read the relevant sections of Withers (1992) to refresh your memory or gain anything you missed the first time around. Armed with those basics, write solid background into your Methods and bullet point your Introduction. Withers does a good job of reviewing particulars of each taxon in an overview after covering the basics.\nBrainstorm with your partner to make sure you both really get it. Brainstorm to identify some interesting scenarios to model. Come up with Your Question.\nSearch the literature (look in Withers too) for specific information you need to tailor your model to your organism for its scenario, or for its morphology, or any other unique features of environment, etc. The library guide may be helpful. Bird people should definitely look at Sturkieʻs Avian Physiology.\nCrank out your model. Write it on paper. With units :D. Make sure they cancel properly. Write it out again, make sure itʻs clean without any errors.\nWrite out your results and organize your tables to show the answer to Your Question. Make it pop. Tell us what happened.\nGo back and update your Methods - make sure you are explicit about the scenario youʻre testing and what values/parameters you modified to test it. (update your hypothesis if needed to keep it aligned with what youʻre doing here)\nStare hard at your numbers and write your Discussion, starting with interpretation of your direct Results. Broaden out and put your results in context of other great background youʻve come across, or additional topics like what if your animal went further? interaction with other physiological systems, whether it applies to other animals? Which or which not? etc. you could go on and on. (but please donʻt! :)\nCircle back and write your Introduction. Your goal is to make your hypothesis pop. Remember you are writing for physiologists, so you don’t have to explain the basics. Focus on developing the problem for your animal. Hit the main elements that you will focus on in your analysis. Just enough so we can understand and appreciate your hypothesis.\nPrint it out.\nEdit the entire paper, starting with the introduction. Stare hard at the essential topics in your analysis and make sure youʻve hit all the important ideas to prepare your reader. Move extra juicy details to discussion or a better place. Eliminate repetition. Foreshadow the analysis. End with strong hypothesis.\nCross out all repetition. Cut. Be brutal.\nRead it over to make sure everything is well connected. Itʻs all about the ideas, baby! Command them.\nWrite the Abstract, following the Nature Summary Paragraph example we will go over in lab.\nAll pau!\n\n\n\n4. Dead Space\nDepending on your lung-breathing animal, you may have trouble finding dead space volume. Sometimes dead space is called “tracheal volume” so add that to your search terms in addition to “dead space volume”.\nAlso, I found a bunch of good info by searching for “PO\\(_2\\) lizard exercise” etc. This information is somethimes found in the exercise physiology literature.\nFor those of you working on dinosaurs and etc., you should be able to get V\\(_L\\) and V\\(_t\\) for lizards with scaling equations in Withers (1992), but to get the dead space you may have get creative with your modeling. For example, by finding V\\(_d\\) and V\\(_L\\) in some animal (say a sea turtle), then look at the relationship betwen these two parameters in living animals from Withers (1992, e.g. the ratio of V\\(_d\\) to V\\(_L\\)), and apply the ratio to your animal for its V\\(_d\\). This method at least is an estimate based on the best information we have.\nAlso if your animal had an unusually long or wide neck, you may want to test your “lizard” or “turtle” model, etc. against a customized dead space model that takes that unusual anatomy into account (come up with a geometric argument to customize your dead space). Just ignore if this doesnʻt apply to you. But feel free to tailor your model to fit your ideas."

    "text": "Suggestions for Respiration\nYou have a choice in Design 3 projects. You may choose to model [Circulation] instead of Respiration, if you like.\nNOTE1: See me for help early if you need assistance finding the data for the last two paragraphs of the assignment.\nNOTE2: These are just suggestions for creating an interesting design project. You may pick and choose or go in other directions if you wish. Just make sure you put in a similar amount of effort and find interesting results.\nDraw and describe what the respiratory system of your animal might have looked like. Describe how ventilation might have been accomplished (the mechanics of the pumps that moved air in and out of the lungs or water over the gills).\nIf your animal had lungs and breathed air, use allometric relationships from Withers (1992, table 13-8) to calculate lung volume (V\\(_L\\)), tidal volume (V\\(_t\\)), dead space volume (V\\(_d\\)), and alveolar ventilation volume (V\\(_A\\)). I will also post additional articles under “Supplementary Readings”. If your animal had gills, draw the counter-current gas exchange system of your animal (giving water and capillary pO\\(_2\\)).\nCalculate pO\\(_{2ex}\\). Calculate FO\\(_{2in}\\) and FO\\(_{2ex}\\). What might the oxygen extraction efficiency of your animal have been?\nCalculate VO\\(_2\\) at RMR (in liters O\\(_2\\)/min). Calculate V\\(_E\\) (minute volume) at rest in liters air/minute (or liters water/min). If you have an estimate for tidal volume, calculate breathing rate. If you can estimate breathing rate, calculate tidal volume.\nRedo these calculations for maximum exercise (MMR). How much have the variables changed from rest, relative to the increase in metabolic rate? (For example, does breathing rate increase by 10 times if the metabolic rate goes up by 10 times?)\nFor air-breathing animals: Calculate the oxygen flux (i.e., VO\\(_2\\)) between the lung and the blood at RMR that would be predicted from average measured values of DLO2 (pulmonary diffusion capacity; Withers table 13-7) and (p\\(_A\\)O\\(_2\\) – p\\(_c\\)O\\(_2\\)). How does this compare with the required VO\\(_2\\) of your animal? Is it likely that your animal had a respiratory system that is typical for the group to which it belongs (e.g., a mammal or a reptile or a bird, etc.?) Calculate the oxygen flux between the lung and the blood at MMR. How does this compare with the required VO\\(_2\\)? Describe how oxygen flux between the lung and the blood increased between rest and maximal exercise. What changes occurred to increase oxygen delivery?\nFor water-breathing animals (with gills): Use the equations for diffusion from water into capillary blood to calculate the surface area of the gills required to support the Maximum Metabolic Rate (MMR). Is this surface area reasonable? Try to find a measured value for an animal similar to your animal from Withers (table 12-8) or the literature.

If you want to design your own, please run it by me so I can advise on on whether you have enough.\n\nSuggestions\nSet the initial conditions for the osmoregulation balance sheet. Was your animal terrestrial or aquatic? What was the osmolarity of its body fluids? If your animal was ureo-osmoconforming, designate the proportion of total osmolarity due to urea and the proportion due to other solutes. If your animal was aquatic, what was the osmolarity of the medium? If your animal was terrestrial, what were the temperature and relative humidity of the air? Did your animal need to use evaporation for cooling? How many kJ/day must have been lost through evaporation (from temperature design)? How many grams of water must have been evaporated to lose this much heat (heat of evaporation = 2.4 kJ/g water).\nMake up a qualitative (no numbers yet) water balance sheet for your animal. List all of the ways that the animal gains and loses water (water in and water out), and explain them in words.\nCalculate theoretical values for the elements of the water balance sheet. When calculating urine volume, calculate the volume required to excrete nitrogenous wastes, given the maximum possible nitrogen concentration. Assume the animal is in water balance (set total water in = total water out). Calculate the amount that the animal must drink to stay in water balance. If this value is negative, then the animal has more water than it needs and will produce a more dilute urine. Increase urine volume to compensate for this, and assume zero drinking.\nMake up a qualitative solute balance sheet for your animal (solutes in and solutes out). List all of the ways that the animal gains and loses solutes, and explain them in words.\nDescribe the excretory organs of your animal. What nitrogenous end product did your animal excrete (ammonia, urea, uric acid)? What was the role of the kidney in nitrogen excretion and water and solute balance? How did it perform these functions? Did the animal have other excretory organs (salt glands, chloride cells in gills, etc.)?\n[pdf] version of this sheet\n[Helpful resources] - a few helpful papers.

    "text": "Suggestions for Circulation\nYou have a choice in Design 3 projects. You may choose to model [Respiration] instead of Circulation, if you like.\nAgain, you are free to take your design in any direction you wish. Below are some suggestions:\n\nDraw a schematic diagram of the circulatory system of your animal. Include the major target organs. Does your animal have a single, partially divided, or fully divided circulation? Discuss the functional implications of your animal’s system (and draw circulation during shunting, if this happens).\nDevelop oxygen dissociation curves for your animal at rest. Try to find examples from the textbook or from the literature of dissociation curves from an animal that is similar to your animal. Then use a piece of graph paper to draw a non-Bohr shifted curve (representing the dissociation curve in the lungs). Then select a reasonable pH change in the tissues during rest (-0.05 to -0.1 pH points) and a Bohr effect factor from Withers (1992, Table 15-4). P\\(_{50}\\) is the pO\\(_2\\) for 50% oxygen saturation. Use these values to calculate P\\(_{50}\\) and draw a Bohr-shifted oxygen dissociation curve for the tissues at rest. What is the magnitude of the Bohr effect (the change in P\\(_{50}\\) per unit change in pH, often expresses as \\(\\Delta\\)log(P\\(_{50}\\))/\\(\\Delta\\)pH)?\nDevelop an oxygen dissociation curve for your animal during exercise. Increase the change in pH to a range that is more appropriate for the high CO2 levels present in the tissues during exercise (0.2-0.8 pH points, depending on intensity of activity). Calculate p502 and draw a Bohr-shifted oxygen dissociation curve for the tissues during exercise (add this graph on the same diagram as the two graphs generated above).\nUse your oxygen dissociation curves to calculate oxygen extraction from the blood at rest and during exercise. Express this in mlO\\(_2\\)/ ml blood.\nCalculate resting heart rate for your animal from the allometric curves for heart rate.\nFrom VO\\(_2\\) at RMR, resting heart rate, and resting extraction, calculate the stroke volume of the heart at rest. Calculate the cardiac output of your animal’s heart. Estimate the volume of the whole heart. How does this compare with a value calculated from the heart volume versus body mass values given in the notes?\nIn order to deliver enough oxygen at MMR, different animals increase heart rate, stroke volume, and extraction by different amounts. Given the value for extraction calculated in #4 above, how much must HR and/or SV increase to meet the increased VO2 at MMR? What proportions of the increase in oxygen delivery are due to each of the components (SV, HR, extraction)?\n\nPossible extras:\n\nDesign a hormonal and neural control system for the cardiac output.\n\nDesign resistance of peripheral vasculature – use variations in resistance to show how blood is distributed to different organs under different circumstances.\n\nMake a quantitative design of heart shunts – shunting will affect C\\(_a\\)O\\(_2\\) and C\\(_v\\)O\\(_2\\).\n\nBe sure to check out the\n\n[Design 3 Process] for helpful tips\n[Index of papers] for helpful resources.

    "title": "Design 1 Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1. Don’t forget to include page numbers!\n\n\n2. Can I use an the website XX as a source?\nIn general, no. You must use sources that scientists would use – that is, primarily peer-reviewed articles, reference books, and text books (books written for scientists). Websites which you CAN use are scientific databases or official information portals, for example the NOAA weather database (this is just an electronic form of their official data).\nWebsites that are geared for educating the general public are not sources that scientists would use. That being said, Wikipedia while not a valid source, often has great citations – which you can use! So make the best with what you have. If you run out of time, for now just use what you have and get on with your analysis – ask for help, and when you find a better source plug it in. The quality of your information is really the backbone of your project. The stronger it is, the better your papers will be.\n\n\n3. Should I use a value of XX for my AMR multiplier? What should I use?\nThis is one of the major assumptions of your project (i.e., for you to figure out and justify). You should base it on whatever biological information you have on your animal. For example, look at the metabolic rate papers under supplemental readings https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M8ygipZEd9OUdld45C4BGgfJw2KWUKYk?usp=share_link. There are two papers on mammals, one on the “lower vertebrates” (fish and lizards, etc.; Bennett 1978), and one on birds (Butler 91 – not me). Use your biological information to decide how active an animal it was. Then find a similar animal (whatever is closest phylogenetically and/or most behaviorally similar) and use that multiplier for your animal. Do your best with what information you have. If you don’t have any information or data, you can make an educated guess by thinking about what kinds of activities your animal engaged in and choosing analogous activities (similar effort) from the human in Withers and calculating your own multiplier. Do think about how much time it is doing any activity. For example if you say it runs and assign 8 hours to that activity, you are saying it is running non-stop for 8 hours(!). Having good reasons for your assumptions makes your paper much stronger (reviewers and critics have a harder time arguing with data), so be sure to clearly explain why you chose what you did.\n\n\n4. What goes in the Methods section?\nMethods =&gt; the how I did it section\nFor the methods, you want to get straight to the point with regard to how you modeled your animal. The statement of purpose (or hypothesis) should be presented in the introduction. So dive right in with your modeling strategy: “We modeled BMR based on the scaling equation for XX because YY…”. Remember to put all equations with citations, parameters clearly indicated with units, and give the values you assumed for each parameter with a justification and citation.\nI usually recommend folks to have sections: For example, how you modeled - the metabolic rates, and importantly DMR. - the components of heat - the scenarios (heat balance at rest was calculated assuming…,) + heat balance at rest + heat balance over a typical day (DMR) + heat stress (or can be cold stress)\nFor the scenarios, after explaining how you got each component of heat, you explain what you are imagining your animal doing, and what assumptions you chose to model that.\nResults =&gt; the what happened section\nIn the results, you put your calculations and what you found. Don’t forget that you need to write it out in text as well as whatever numbers and other things you may have. Don’t forget to try a heat stress scenario to see how much your model can explain. In the discussion, write about what it all means for your animal. Did you find any limitations? How would it have affected its behavior or biology? Write the abstract last (starting with design 2). It should be a synposis (a concise summary) of your paper. For a model abstract, have a look at the “Nature Summary Paragraph” under “course docs/writing aids” on the website.\n\n\n5. How do I get WATER VAPOR DENSITY for my animal?\nDepending on your ambient temperature and relative humidity, you can calculate the Water Vapor Density using this table. (Nave 20XX). Look up the value for Water Vapor Density according to your temperature, and multiply by your relative humidity.\nNote: g/m\\(^3\\) works out to be mg/L, which is what you need for the EWL equations.\ng/m\\(^3\\) = g/(100cm)^3 = g/[\\(10^6\\)cm\\(^3\\)] = mg/\\(10^3\\)cm\\(^3\\) = mg/1000ml = mg/L\nCitation: Nave, C. (20XX) Saturated Vapor Pressure, Density, for Water.Hyperphysics. Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University, http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/kinetic/watvap.html. Accessed Sept. XX 20XX.\nWater Vapor Density varies linearly with Temperature, so you can just interpolate to get values in-between the ones given in the table.\nFor example: If our ambient temp Ta=27C, but we have values for 25C and 30C, we can obtain water vapor density at 27C by interpolating. Start from the density value at 25C and add 2/5 of the increase at 30C because 27C is 2/5 of the way between 25 and 30C (you can also come up with your own way to do this).\n\\(d_{25C}\\) = 23g/m\\(^3\\)\n\\(d_{30C}\\) = 30.4g/m\\(^3\\)\n\\(d_{27C}\\) = \\(d_{25C}\\) + \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) \\(\\times\\) [\\(d_{30C}\\) - \\(d_{25C}\\)]\n\\(d_{27C}\\) = 23g/m\\(^3\\) + \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) \\(\\times\\) (30.4 - 23)g/m\\(^3\\) \\(d_{27C}\\) = 25.96g/m\\(^3\\)\nThe table provides density values for “Saturated” water vapor, which means at 100% relative humidity. If your animal lived at 40% RH, for example, then:\n\\(d_{27C at 40\\%RH}\\) = 0.4 \\(\\times\\) 25.96g/m\\(^3\\) = 10.38g/m\\(^3\\) = 10.38mg/L\n\nHow do I get O2 extraction efficiency for my animal?\n\nThis information is in Chapters 11 and 12. For fish, please use table 12-9 and look at pages 595-596. It is between 20-60% (a large range!). Choose based on an animal with a similar activity level (is your fish an active swimming fish, or very lethargic?) Activity level and phylogeny should dictate which value you choose. For animals with lungs (terrestrial animals), look at page: 628. For mammals, the value is typically 20-25% (Withers says humans are at about 23% – I know, I need to edit the sample calculations). Extraction efficiency will be determined by lung type and activity level. Mammals, reptiles, and amphibians (if they have lungs) have tidal lungs. So reptiles and amphibians should be at the lower end of that range (closer to 20%). Birds, however, have a special lung with higher O2 efficiency at about 40% (Withers says 41.3).\n\nThe iterative method is blowing up Tb for my gigantic ectotherm!\n\nIf you have a VERY large ectotherm, then the iterative method may blow up. Think about what that means - Hc is not big enough to dump all of the heat from Hm, which is a very cool finding! So first you will want to demonstrate that that is happening. Include this in your paper.\nThen think about whether or not your animal may have additional adaptations to lose heat. Can you think of any? Come in to see us and we can chat about it. You may have found papers on a homeothermic hypothesis - the idea that they may have had mechanisms to limit Tb. If so, you can then compare to what you might expect if Tb is kept in check, that would be very interesting. Even if you can’t figure out exactly how heat balance is achieved, you can still model the various factors and demonstrate exactly what your animal’s problems might have been. That is very interesting!\n\nMy animal is burning up (Hr)!\n\nThink about Hr a bit more precisely. How many hours would it be in full sun? Obviously it’s not going to be 24 hours. How much of it’s body is exposed to direct sunlight? etc. Try to estimate. Explain what you’re doing in the model and why. If it is in shade, Hr will go to zero."

Also if you use lean steaks for example, you will have to factor in the fats and indigestibles, etc. Please also think about whether your animal will be eating its prey whole or if it will eat parts of a carcass (muscle, organs, blood?, etc.).\nSome agriculture definitions:\n\nLive weight of animals intended for slaughter is the weight taken immediately before slaughter.\nKilled weight is the gross weight of the carcass including the hide or skin, head, feet and internal organs, but excluding the part of the blood which is not collected in the course of slaughter.\nDressed carcass weight is the weight of the carcass after removal of: skin, head, feet, genitals, internal organs, tail, and slaughter fats.\nCarcass weight is the same as above but plus the slaughter fats\n\nThe USDA database has some great data with nutritional content for carcasses.  So keep in mind that you will lose some water weight because of blood loss, etc. Animals are about 70% water overall (there is a figure in Withers I think in the osmotic balance chapter that shows the water content of various taxa), so if your animals eat their prey whole you might want to factor that in – the main effect is that it reduce the energy density of the food and your animal will have to eat more prey items.\n\n\n4. Note!! Make sure your values have factored in water content.\nEspecially for those working with plants, percent proteins, carbs and fats are most often given in dry weight. Because of the methods used to analyze nutritional contents, it is almost always dried prior to analysis. Your animal will most likely eat them fresh, so you will have to adjust the values.\nGiven values for grass hay:\n%Dry matter = 92% (this means that it’s 8% water) This does not mean that the grass that was growing for the hay has only 8% water, but that the grass was dried down to have only 8% water.\n%carbs dry weight = 19.9% - the dried hay is rich in carbs. But what about % carbs in the fresh grass?\nIf we assume that the fresh grass is 20% dry matter/ 80% water, the % carbs in the fresh food is:\n%carbs in hay * % Dry matter hay + 0 * % water = % carbs in fresh grass\n.0199 * .2 + 0 * .8 = 0.0398 pr 4% carbs in fresh grass\nPlease note: alfalfa is a legume (bean family), not a “grass” so it’s pretty high in protein.\n\n\n5. Values for Grass (also Leaves or Woody Plants)\nIt turns out that high carbs is a big problem in equine medicine, and so there are companies that will do nutritional analysis of your grass. Dairy One is such a company, and they have an online database with average values for the past 10 years. You can look up data on grass hay and grass pasture, or silage. Hay is dried grass, pasture is fresh grass. Don’t use the silage values because silage is a mash of partly fermented plant product that is only farm food (not wild). You may use this website:\nhttp://dairyone.com/analytical-services/feed-and-forage/feed-composition-library/interactive-feed-composition-library/\nClick “OK” at the bottom of this page and then “Main library” then make your choices. You might want to choose Fresh for Forage and then in the pull down menu grass pasture, for example. Choose leaves for general mixed leaves and woody plants for woody browse.\nInterpreting the numbers: The first number is % dry matter. So the Grass hay is 92% dry matter (8% water). Grass Pasture when it is hydrated (at the most hydrated end of its normal range) is 19% dry matter 81% water, at the driest end of normal it is 78% dry matter, etc.). The rest of the values are percentages of the dry matter. For protein values I would use the soluble protein value, which is a % of crude protein so if:\n% crude protein = 35% (of Dry Matter)\nSoluble protein, % of CP = 15%\nThen protein % of dry matter = .15 * .35 = .0525 or roughly 5% of the dry matter is protein.\nHow much of the fresh grass is protein?\nif grass is 19% dry matter and 81% water, then take a weighted average of the percent protein in dry matter plus percent protein in water (zero of course):\n0.0525 * 0.19 + 0 * 0.81 = 0.009975 or about 1% of the fresh grass is protein. Etc. etc. for carbs and fibers.\n(dry matter) + (water )\nTotal carbohydrates is WSC (water soluble carbs) + Starch.\nMAKE SURE you don’t use LEGUME hay or Alfalfa! Those cultivated by humans for feed but are from the bean family and are very rich in protein. Wild animals would not have access to alfalfa pastures on the regular.\n\n\n6. Where can I find a gut diameter for my animal?\nA good review is provided in Stevens and Hume 1998 (Shared Google Drive, Digestion papers). Start there.\nIf you are not able to find a gut diameter in the primary literature (journal articles) using such terms as “small intestine” or “gut diameter” and “mammals” or “predator” etc., then I would recommend looking in specialized textbooks either for your taxon or physiology: e.g., digestive physiology of mammals, avian physiology, physiology of fishes, a general mammology book, etc. There are a lot of such texts in Hamilton Library. It may not be so easy to find this data in the recent primary literature for your species if it does not have unusual digestive physiology because this is kind of “old news” as far as data goes. But it should be in these types of books.\nREMEMBER, just use the best information that you can find, but don’t let it hold up your analysis. If you have a large mammalian carnivore, but can cannot find a close relative, try to find the gut diameter of ANY large mammalian carnivore (next best) or at least a large mammal (third best). Use the gut diameter of a human only as a last resort :). But do the best with what you have.\n\n\n7. What transporter rate should I use?\nFirst find range of transporter rates for your taxon and type of nutrient (you only need to do the limiting one) from Withers (read the digestion chapter supplement all the way to the end). Then decide what is a reasonable assumption for your animal. Should it be in the top of the range or the bottom? Just think about it and decide if you can come up with a good reason for one or the other. It’s in putting together all these little bits of information that you enrich your model and demonstrate your knowledge of physiology. If you can’t think of anything, you can always go with the middle of the range.\n\n\n8. Where should the description of the Gastrointestinal system go?\nThe GI system should probably be described in the intro, or in a “background” section that can be placed between the intro and the methods or at the start of the methods. You can bring up specific details in the discussion if they come into play.\n\n\n9. What do we discuss if we found that the intestine length makes sense inside our animal? There seems to be little to analyze.\nIf you have a carnivore it won’t be as interesting a system to model in the sense that you won’t run into too many “problems”. But what you should think about is how the digestive system affects the physiology and the biology of the animal. Was it easy or difficult for the animal to meet its nutritional requirements (both caloric and glucose for the brain, vitamins and minerals)? Was it easy to find enough food? A reasonable effort per day? A daily or an intermittent feeder? For it to fit inside it’s stomach? Would it be able to find food all year? Or would it have to fatten up, etc.?\nThese are just suggestions. Think about what you found and how it would influence the digestive and nutrional physiology of the animal. And if it is easy, then great. But just do a thorough explanation of how easy it was for your animal to make a living.\n\n\n10. How do I modify the introduction from Design 1?\nEach paper should be able to stand alone. You will want to introduce your animal with the aim to introduce a project on feeding and digestion. So you need to introduce the most interesting things about your animal, and relate as much of the intro as possible to how it acquires its food and digests it. For example, when you introduce the general habitat, you might lead into the food available to your animal. When you talk about morphology, start slanting it toward how it will obtain and consume its food (feeding) and digestion, etc. For predators it is really interesting to describe how it will hunt and kill, which would lead to foraging strategy. For herbivores be sure to think about whether it would be a browser or a grazer. You can refer to your first paper for specifics about metabolism.\n\n\n11. Herbivore diets (making a living eating plants)\nI’ve posted a few papers on the Shared Google Drive under “Herbivore Diets”\nRogers et al 1990 and Stoddart 35 contain water content of plant information. Plants use a lot of water for transpiration (about 90% of they take up is transpired eventually). Because they are so dynamic, water content can vary a lot within a plant, as well as seasonally and across species. It seems that most plants are about 70-85% water, but the range can vary from 50% up to 90%.\nDemment and Van Soest 85 is a very influential paper about mammalian herbivores. It tries to model the difference between ruminant and non-ruminant (mostly hindgut fermenting) mammalian herbivores. The model considers body weight, food intake, energy extraction, volume, and retention time. There is a long-standing observation that small herbivores and very large herbivores tend to be hind-gut fermenters, whereas ruminants dominate the medium-sized herbivores.\nOne idea is that if you’re very small, then you can selectively forage (browse) and maintain your MR on high-quality foods. As you get larger, though, you need more calories and you must expand your dietary breadth. So while small animals may be able to get most of their nutrition from direct digestion of foods, as they get larger, they need to rely more and more on fermentation. The two relevant parts of the plant for the herbivores are the cell wall, which contains the cellulose and hemicellulose (structural fibers) and must be fermented, and the cell cytosol, which contains the directly digestible portion of the plant (the sugars, proteins, fast, non-structural carbohydrates).\nIf you are a ruminant, your food MUST pass through the fermentation chamber first before getting into the stomach – so all of your food is fermented first. It is also much slower, so there is greater nutrient extraction and fermentation efficiency, but because it must pass through the rumen first, all of it has to get fermented – even the cytosol components. For a small herbivore, this is not advantageous if you can get all your requirements from direct digestion, because you’ve added another trophic level (the gut microbes) which will use up some of the energy, even though they are not “needed”. This is the idea behind why small herbivores are hind-gut fermenters.\nAs you get larger and need to eat more food, you must expand their dietary breadth and incorporate more poor quality foods, resulting in the need to be able to digest the cell walls. Fermentation is essential. If you are a ruminant, then you can survive on even lower quality food because the retention time (how long digestion takes) is longer, the longer it is, the more extraction you get. This can only be increased for so long, however, after a while, no matter how long you increase retention time, you won’t get any more out of the food. So if you get to be a very large herbivore, then you hit an upper limit, and need to increase throughput. Thus, the theory predicts that very large herbivores are hind-gut fermentors. One disadvantage of hindgut fermentation is that you can’t recover the energy that went into bacterial growth, whereas ruminants can (the microbes pass through the stomach and SI, so they can get digested). Fermentation in the hindgut occurs at the end of the digetstive tract, so they come out as feces. However, they get greater overall energy by just simply processing a lot more food.\nWhat does this all mean for your design project? Well, for a ruminant – you need to “ferment” all of your food. You can look through the end of the digestion chapter in Withers where he has a breakdown of how much ingested energy goes to various components and start your model based on that. For the hindgut fermenter, you can estimate the amount of energy obtained from direct digestion, as well as hindgut fermentation. You can either base the energy from fermentation on the horse example given in the book, or look at the Robbins Tables in the supplementary readings which lists a bunch of values for energy obtained from hindgut fermentation for mammals and birds. If your animal is a reptile, there are papers that you can look up, mostly on iguana digestion.\nIf you want to try a more challenging route, for either hindgut or foregut (mammals), you can try to follow the modeling in the Demment and Van Soest paper which will give you a model more specific for your animal’s body weight."

The hardware needs to be connected before you open the settings file.\nRemove any jewelry from the volunteer’s face, ears, and neck.\nUnwind and straighten all of the flat electrodes. Attach the leads of the EEG Flat Electrodes the pins closest to the labled side of the Bio Amp Cable. You will need all 5 leads.\nRefer to (Figure 3) for proper electrode placement, but note that we will be using 5 electrodes: two on the frontal lobe and two on the occipital lobe, and a ground.\n\n\nFrontal lobe: Channel 1 “positive” and “negative” electrodes will be 3-4cm apart on either side of the forehead.\nOccipital lobe: Channel 2 “positive” and “negative” electrodes will be 3-4cm apart on the back of the head (where the skull bulges out). Place the\nEarth electrode on the bare skin on the bone just behind the ear on the left side.\n\n\nFor the occipital lobe, it helps to part the hair across the back of the head from side to side to expose the electrode area for the occipital lobe and use hair pins to keep the hair out of the way. For long-haired subjects, rubber bands to make a top-knot ponytail may help.\nYou can use a ballpoint pen to lightly mark the skin if you wish. Let the subject abrade their own skin with a fingernail or an alcohol swab to remove dead skin cells. Abrasion helps reduce the skinʻs resistance.\nApply electrode Paste to the EEG Flat Electrodes. When the skin is dry stick the electrodes to the skin (Figure 3) and keep the electrodes and wires in place with the medical tape. Avoid air gaps. Wrap the ACE bandage around the head to press the flat electrodes snugly on the head in good contact with the skin.\nHave the volunteer seated in a comfortable position at the table with paper and pen and a laptop in front of them. During the experiment is important to minimize muscle movement and ensure that none of the electrodes are disturbed or compressed.\nCheck that all five electrodes are properly connected to the volunteer and the Bio Amp Cable before proceeding. Make sure the electrode wires do not cross over any power cables or electronic equipment. Turn on the PowerLab. (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Electrodes and cable setup. We will use five electrodes to record from two channels and a ground. Follow instructions provided by your TA for electrode placement."

You may have to change the inputs to match the correct channel number. If you are using the new setup, you may have to change and restart Chart (several times) with the Bioamp cable connected for it to appear in the menu.

    "section": "Analysis of Urine",
    "text": "Analysis of Urine\nWe will measure the urine volume (using a graduated flask), chloride ion content, and the chemical/biological composition of urine using a chemstrip urinalysis test product (used for initial clinical diagnostic screening). The chemstrip tests for a number of different properties of urine, including specific gravity, pH, infection, immune system activity, insulin imbalance, blood chemistry, and liver function.\n\nHere is a detailed description of what the chemstrip measures:\n\nSpecific Gravity: The specific gravity test permits the determination of urine specific gravity between 1.000 and 1.030. For increased accuracy, 0.005 maybe added to readings from urine with pH equal to or greater than 6.5. Elevated specific gravity readings may be obtained in the presence of moderate quantities (1‑7.5 g/L) of protein. The specific gravity of urine is a measurement of the density of urine; the relative proportions of dissolved solids in relationship to the total volume of the specimen. It reflects how concentrated or diluted a sample may be. Water has a specific gravity of 1.000. Urine will always have a value greater than 1.000 depending upon the amount of dissolved substances (salts, minerals, etc.) that may be present. Very dilute urine has a low specific gravity value and very concentrated urine has a high value. Specific gravity measures the ability of the kidneys to concentrate or dilute urine depending on fluctuating conditions. Normal range 1.005 - 1.030, average range 1.010 - 1.025. Low specific gravity is associated with conditions like diabetes insipidus, excessive water intake, diuretic use or chronic renal failure.\nGlucose: The glucose reagent panel is specific for glucose. The reactivity of the glucose test decreases as the Specific Gravity of the urine increases. Small amounts of glucose may normally be excreted by the kidneys, these amounts are usually below the sensitivity range of this test but on occasion may produce a color between the ‘Negative’ and the 100/5 color block and may be interpreted by the observer as positive. Glycosuria is the condition of glucose in urine. Normally the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the renal tubules and returned to the blood by carrier molecules. If blood glucose levels exceed renal threshold levels, the un-transported glucose will spill over into the urine. Main cause: diabetes mellitus\nKetones: This test reacts with acetoacetic acid in urine. It does not react with acetone or β−hydroxybutyric acid. Some high specific gravity/low pH urines may give reactions up to and including ‘Trace’. Normal urine specimens usually yield negative results with this reagent. False positive results (trace or less) may occur with highly pigmented urine specimens. Ketone bodies such as acetoacetic acid, β−hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone can appear in urine in small amounts. These intermediate by-products are associated with the breakdown of fat. Causes: diabetes mellitus, starvation, diarrhea.\nBlood: Blood is often found in the urine of menstruating females. This test is equally sensitive to hemoglobin and myoglobin. The sensitivity of this test may be reduced in urines with high specific gravity. False positives reactions can be caused by certain oxidizing contaminants such as hypochlorite and microbial peroxidase associated with urinary ’tract infection. Hemoglobinuria is the presence of hemoglobin in the urine. Causes: hemolytic anemia, blood transfusion reactions, massive bums, renal disease Hematuria is the presence of intact erythrocytes and is almost always pathological. Causes: kidney stones, tumors, glomerulonephritis, physical trauma.\npH: The pH test area measures pH values within the range of 5 - 8.5. Average is 6.0, slightly acidic. High protein diets increase acidity. Vegetarian diets increase alkalinity. Bacterial infections also increase alkalinity.\nProtein: The reagent area is more sensitive to albumin than to globulins, hemoglobin, and mucoprotein. A ‘Negative’ result does not rule out the presence of other proteins. Normally no protein is detectable in urine by conventional methods, although a minute amount is excreted by the normal kidney. A color matching any block greater than ‘Trace’ indicates significant proteinuria. For urine of high specific gravity, the test area may most closely match the ‘Trace’ color block even though only normal concentrations of protein are present. False positive results may be obtained with highly alkaline urines (pH &gt;8.5). Albumin is normally too large to pass through glomerulus tissue, therefore elevated results Indicate abnormal increased permeability of the glomerulus membrane. Non-pathological causes are: pregnancy, physical exertion, increased protein consumption. Pathological causes are: glomerulonephritis bacterial toxins, chemical poisons. \nNitrite: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate (derived from the diet) to nitrite by the action of principally gram-negative bacteria in the urine. The test is specific for nitrite and will not react with any other substance normally excreted in urine. Pink spots or pink edges should not be interpreted as a positive result. Any degree of uniform pink color development should be interpreted as a positive nitrite test suggesting the presence of 100,000 or more organisms per ml, but color development is not proportional to the number of bacteria present. A negative result does not in itself prove that there is no significant bacteriuria. Negatives may occur when urinary tract infections are caused by organism which do not contain reductase to convert nitrate to nitrite; when urine has not been retained in the bladder long enough (4 hours or more) for reduction of nitrate to occur; or when dietary nitrate is absent, even if organisms containing reductase are present and the bladder incubation is ample. Sensitivity of the nitrite test is reduced for urines with a high specific gravity. High abnormal readings indicate the presence of bacteria. Causes: urinary tract infection.\nLeucocytes: Normal urine specimens generally yield negative results; positive results of small (+) or greater are clinically significant. Individually observed ‘Trace’ results may be of questionable clinical significance; however, ‘Trace’ results observed repeatedly may be clinically significant. ‘Positive’ results may occasionally be found with random specimens from females due to contamination of the specimen by vaginal discharge. Elevated glucose concentrations or high specific gravity may cause decreased test results. The presence of leukocytes in urine is referred to as pyuria (pus in the urine). Causes: urinary tract infection.\nUrobilinogen: This test area will detect urobilinogen (a bile pigment derived from hemoglobin breakdown) in concentrations as low as 3 mIU/L in urine. The majority of this substance is excreted in the stool, but small amounts are reabsorbed into the blood from the intestines and then excreted into the urine. Causes: hemolytic anemia, liver diseases.\nBilirubin: Normally no bilirubin is detected in urine. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of hemoglobin in red blood cells. The globin portion of hemoglobin is split off and the heme groups of hemoglobin is converted into the pigment bilirubin. Bilirubin is secreted in blood and carried to the liver where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid. Some is secreted in blood and some is excreted in the bile as bile pigments into the small intestines. The presence of trace amounts of bilirubin are abnormal, and require further investigation. Atypical result colors may indicate bile pigment abnormalities. Metabolites of drugs such as Pyridium and Serenium may cause false positives. Ascorbic acid concentrations of 1.42 mIU/L or greater may cause false positives. Causes: liver disorders, cirrhosis, hepatitis, obstruction of bile duct."

Set up and testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Attachment of the respiratory belt transducer to the calf for leg volume measurement.\n\n\n\n\nAttach the respiratory belt transducer to Input 1, and the pulse transducer to Input 2.\nUse “Lab 3-Dive Response…” settings to start Chart software.\nAdd 2 channels for Pulse Flow and Heart Rate.\n\n\nFrom the menu bar, choose Setup &gt; Channel Settings. At the bottom of the menu, increase the number of channels to 3.\n\nIf you attached the pulse transducer before you opened the software, it should detect the pulse transducer and say so in the Input Amplifier column. If not, quit the software and reopen it via the settings file now that all the sensors are attached.\nName channel 2 “Pulse Flow”. In the box that pops up change the source to Channel 2 (to match the sensor input). Under Calculation, select Integral, (the default Standard Integral) and OK. This will tell us the relative volume of blood flowing through our pulse.\nName channle 3 “Heart Rate (BPM)”. Select Calculation &gt; Cyclic Measurements. Change the source to Channel 2 (calculating from the pulse transducer data), and ensure Measurement is set to Rate.\nIn this experiment, the sphygnamanometer is attached to a thigh cuff and used only to restrict blood flow to the thigh and not plugged in to PowerLab.\n\n\nSet up and maintain a wash basin with icewater deep enough to submerge your face up to your temples. Use a thermometer to monitor temperature at 10-15C (50-60F), replenish with ice as needed.\nAttach the respiratory belt snugly to the calf (Figure 4). It should feel tight and the sensor fabric should be slightly stretched.\nPlace the thigh cuff around the subject’s thigh. You may or many not need to use duct tape if the cuff does not remain securely pressurized to restrict blood flow. If needed, apply tape to secure both the top and the bottom of the cuff.\nRecord for 10 seconds and stop. Scale the Pulse channel and the Leg Volume channel to fully display the data.\nRecord again and test by flexing and relaxing your calf. You should be able to see a clear deflection on the leg volume channel. If it is very small, try tightening the respiratory belt a little. Check with your TA that you are receiving a good signal before moving on.\nFor all experiments, resting position for the subject is sitting while leaning over the basin with the face just above water.\nUse a timer to time the treatments (a cell phone or a web browser will do).\nYou will want to use a compressed timescale to see the dive response. Try 100:1, 200:1, etc.\nAlways fully deflate the cuff (you may have to squeeze out the air) after depressurizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea behind measuring peripheral circulation using leg volume changes\n\n\n\nWe can quantify the volume in your peripheral circulation (specifically your lower leg) by assessing venous pooling for a standard time interval. By constricting blood flow to the lower limb, we will prevent venous return of the blood. Because the veins have little smooth muscle, it is relatively easy to stop venous return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol: Basic Leg volume measurement\n\n\n\nYou will use the sphygnomanometer cuff to cut off circulation in the leg for 20 sec. at the upper thigh. The respiratory belt transducer senses stretch and can be used to measure calf volume (Figure 4) before, during inflation, and after deflating the cuff (recovery).\n\nRecord the subject’s resting recording for 10 seconds.\nRapidly Inflate the cuff to 60 mmHg (or whatever pressure feels tight enough to restrict blood flow for the subject [I used 80 mmHg], the pressure should be same for all measurements),\nHold pressure for exactly 20 seconds (NOTE: You may have to gently squeeze the bulb to keep pressure constant.)\nQuickly and COMPLETELY release the pressure (Figure 5) by ripping off the velcro without moving the subject.\nRecovery: Record for 30 sec or until the leg volume returns to baseline.\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nBe sure to Comment at the start of each new treatment (start of baseline, start of dive response, etc.)\nIt is critical to have accurate comments for each manipulation above (resting, inflate, at pressure, release, dive, breathing, etc.)\nBe sure to have the comments pre-typed in the comment box and hit enter at the start of each event to accurately place comments in time.\nInflate and release the cuff as fast as possible.\nPractice ripping off the cuff without moving the subject. The experimenter should do it.\n\nWhen doing repeated measurements, ensure you have baseline data for at least 15 sec before inflating the cuff again.\nThe subject will have to hold their breath for about 30 sec. \nMake good comments and minimize movement in the Finger Pulse Transducer."

Everything on worksheets are brief.\nYou may use the Word template or just type up your worksheet for submission. Include the statements of purpose below. For section 2 write a brief sentence for what you would expect to see in the data. Be concise, to the point (no extra words)! Results and Discussion are in paragraph form.\nNotice how much we are emphasizing brief, concise, to the point!, and relevant. Right, Relevant, Righteous!\n\n\n\n\n(1) Statements of Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn a scientific paper, the introduction builds to a statement of purpose (or hypotheses) in the final paragraph of the intro. The statements you see below are examples appropriate for this lab. Study them to guide this assignment, and for future experiments where you will have to write your own. Notice that the physiological mechanisms and the associated variables are clearly stated, along with the hypothesized relationship between them (and experimental design if you can!). In a full paper (or lab report), your introduction would start from the main idea, introduce the mechanisms and connect the dots to the hypotheses in the final paragraph.\n\n\nUse these statements of purpose to frame your thinking about this lab, fill in the blanks:\nDistance from heart – “We demonstrate the predicted drop in blood pressure with distance from the central pump. We explore whether there is a greater drop in systolic or diastolic pressure with distance” (in a full lab report you would set up your ideas for why it might go either way).\nEffect of gravity – “We demonstrate the action of gravity on blood pressure. As vertebrates possess a closed circulatory system, vertical height should contribute to blood pressure in predictable ways.”\nDive response – “When diving, peripheral circulation should be reorganized to reduce cardiac output and increase peripheral vasoconstriction, called the dive response. We aim to observe the dive response by measuring ________________________.”\nStimulus for dive response – “We will test potential triggers for the dive response including ____________________________.””\n\n\n(2) Concept check: demonstrate your understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will we evaluate the hypotheses?\n\n\n\nWhat do you expect to see in the data if the hypothesis is true (if these mechanisms are occurring)? Be specific and relate back to observable parameters: (and relate to controls or confounding parameters, if appropriate). Write a brief sentence for each (just for clarification, this is not a formal “section” of a scientific paper nor a lab report, rather these ideas would be woven throughout the manuscript):\n\nDistance from heart\nEffect of gravity\nDive response\nStimulus for dive response\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) Mini Results\nDisplay your results by including either a figure or a table for each important result (remember to design each to address a hypothesis). You may work together with your group to produce the figures or tables. Write a paragraph for the results with ~one sentence pointing out what your data actually shows for each display item (refer in-text to each figure).\n\n\n(4) Mini Discussion:\nWrap-up: In paragraph form, briefly Discuss the main take-aways that you learned from these experiments on peripheral circulation and the dive response. Use specific results that back up your statements or speculate on the significance of the results. Organize by hypotheses above.\nIndividual assignment. Text must be your own, but you may work together with your group to produce figures/tables. You may edit this sheet. Submit by hard copy next week."

The distance between the electrodes should be 0.5 cm. It is not necessary to connect the green (ground) clip.\nConnect the red (positive) BNC connector from the stimulator electrode to the positive (+) analog output connector on the PowerLab. Connect the black (negative) BNC connector from the stimulator electrode to the negative (–) analog output connector.\nConnect the red and black leads from the first recording electrode to two of the metal rungs of the Nerve Bath (Figure 3). Connect the 8-pin DIN connector to Input 1 of the PowerLab.\nConnect the leads for the second recording electrode (black closer to stimulator, red farther), but place the microhooks further away from the stimulus electrode (Figure 3). Attach the DIN connector to Input 2 on the PowerLab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proper set up of recording and stimulating leads. Note: we will be using alligator clips not hook electrodes\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Pasteur pipette, fill the lower reservoir of the Nerve Bath with frog Ringer’s solution. Fluid in the lower reservoir must not come in contact with the metal electrode rungs. Note: Overfilling the Nerve Bath in this manner will cause a short circuit in your experiment.\nCut a strip of filter paper and lay it over the wires in the nerve bath so that it touches both stimulating electrodes and both sets of recording electrodes. Moisten the paper strip with frog Ringer’s solution, and place the cover on the nerve bath. This arrangement will be used to test the connections.\nBefore turning on the PowerLab, make sure it is connected to the computer via a USB cable.\nLaunch LabChart from your computer using the settings file called Toad Nerve Lab settings.\n\nGo to the Setup menu, select the Stimulator, and then select the waveform Test Connection (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Select waveform - test connection.\n\n\n\n\nOpen LabChart in Scope View. Click Start. LabChart will now automatically record data for 10ms. A series of stimulus pulses will be recorded (Figure 5). You may need to adjust the axes or auto scale to see the signal. If no signal is recorded, check to make sure the microhooks are secure and the filter paper is moist and draped over all the active wires in the Nerve Bath.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Stimulus Artifacts that indicate the equipment is set up properly. Note what the spike of the stimulus voltage looks like, so that you can tell them apart from the CAPs when you run your experiments below.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the connections are tested and working, remove the filter paper and proceed to next step."

If necessary, clean them gently (they are fragile) - ask your TA for help.\nPlug the lead of the dry earth strap into the Earth connection of the Bio Amp cable. Firmly attach the dry earth strap (electrode) around the palm or wrist of the volunteer. Ensure that the fuzzy side of the dry earth strap is in full contact with the skin.\nGently abrade the skin or swab with alcohol to make good electrical contact with the electrodes (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Electrode placement and cable setup.\n\n\n\n\nWith a ballpoint pen, mark two small crosses where the electrodes will be placed on the biceps muscle (Figure 4). The crosses should be 2–3 cm apart and aligned with the long axis of the arm (along the length of the muscle). Do the same for the triceps muscle.\nFill each disk electrode with electrode cream. Place the electrodes onto the skin over the crosses, and fasten them firmly in place with masking tape.\nPlug the leads of the EMG recording electrodes into the Bio Amp cable, as shown in (Figure 3). Polarity doesn’t matter for EMG, but do make sure that the two leads (+ & -) for each channel are attached to the same muscle, and the biceps recording on channel 1, and triceps recording on channel 2.

To do this, under the “Setup” menu choose “setup channels” and check that the input is “Bioamp” (and not “Input Amplifier”). You may have to change the inputs to match the correct channel number. If you are using the new setup, you may have to change and restart Chart (several times) with the Bioamp cable connected for it to appear in the menu. If you are using the old setup, the little green light on the front of the Bioamp should be on. In either case, the channel setup window should indicate “Bioamp”. Ask your TA for help if needed."

    "title": "Design 2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Suggestions for Feeding, Digestion, and Cellular Metabolism\nPlease follow the same format as last time. A lot of information from design 1 will be relevant for design 2, but rewrite it to make a strong connection to feeding and digestion. You should add more detail on how it acquired food, food availability, diet, and any special foraging and digestive strategies, etc. (Just FYI your remaining projects will cover 3:respiration and 4:osmoregulation and excretion (or circulation, or your own design.)) Include the really cool information about your fossil so that we have a better sense of the animal, then move to focusing on the relevant facts for the design project at hand and ends with a strong hypothesis or statement of purpose. Do make sure it is well-integrated, and organized (group your information), and not too long. You can refer to your previous work (cite it!) but each should stand alone just as for any scientific paper.\nYou will start from the daily metabolic rate of your animal (in kJ d\\(^{-1}\\) – you may cite your design 1 using standard scientific format). Did your animal use any anaerobic metabolism to support this metabolic rate (either in a transient or in a sustained manner)? If so, what were the metabolic end-products and what were their fates?\nWhat did your animal eat to support this metabolic rate? How did it acquire this food? (You may want to draw its feeding structures). Include in this description any photosynthetic or chemosynthetic symbionts that it would have. What percentage of the animal’s energy derived from symbionts?\nDescribe (and draw) the GI tract of your animal (for example, see drawings in lecture notes or consult a physiology textbook like those we have in Lab – e.g., Randall et al., Fig. 15-15, 15-16, and 15-22). Include structures for storage, mechanical breakdown, chemical digestion, secretion of digestive enzymes, absorption, and storage of fecal material. If your animal used cellulase producing symbiotic microbes for fermentation, include a region for fermentation to occur.\nFrom the types of foods your animal consumed, determine the percentages of carbohydrates, fats, protein, water, and indigestible material (bone, chitin, cellulose) contained in these foods. You may need to consult a human nutrition book to determine the percentages (Hamilton Library) or you can use the USDA website or papers posted in supplemental readings. Build a dietary model based on foods that are similar to what your animal was eating, but you may have to do some major estimating here (e.g. eating a mouse might be sort-of like eating lean meat, with perhaps 10% indigestible bone and hair). The goal is to be able to say that (based on some similar data) your food contains, for example, 30% carbohydrate, 10% fat, 10% protein, 40% water and 10% indigestible material. Use these percentages to calculate the overall energy density of the food (kJ g\\(^{-1}\\)). (Note: if you are designing a ruminant, the design will be different from this point forward. You may either develop your own model for the design or work with the teaching staff to develop a model).\nHow many grams of food must the animal have absorbed (assimilated) each day to maintain its daily metabolic rate? How many grams of each component (carbs, fats, proteins) must have been absorbed? Convert grams to moles for each component.\nHow many grams of food must the animal have consumed each day? Is the result reasonable? If relevant, calculate the number of food items per day that this represents (for example, 60 insects or 250 leaves, etc.). Is the required foraging effort reasonable? (could your animal have caught or collected this many food items per day?)\nHow did your animal get enough nutrients (vitamins and protein – qualitative analysis)? How many grams of glucose per day are required to support the metabolism of the brain (quantitative analysis)? (The metabolic rate of an average mammal brain is about 8% of BMR, of a reptile or fish is about 2% of SMR). If it did not absorb enough glucose through digestion, where did the glucose come from?\nCalculate the nominal surface area of intestine that your animal required to absorb the carbohydrates and proteins in its diet (don’t forget to correct absorption rates for Q\\(_{10}\\) effects – assume Q\\(_{10}\\) = 2.5).\nFrom the nominal surface area, calculate intestine length and intestine volume. Are the length and volume appropriate for the dimensions of your animal? If not, change the absorption rate and/or change the internal diameter to change the length of the intestine. Are your final absorption rates out of line with measured values (Gut Design Supplemental reading: Withers pp. 946-948)?\nBe sure to check out the [Design 2 FAQs] for helpful tips and [Design 2 Resources]\n[pdf] version of this sheet"

    "text": "Suggestions for Metabolism and Heat Balance Design\nFirst draft (due 9/23 by 5pm): I highly recommend that you make an outline with your partner. Work in this order: begin with completing the full analysis using paper and pencil. Then write the results and methods, followed by the discussion, then the intro. Add citations as you go. Please include your typed calculations as an appendix.\nNote: You are writing a scientific paper (the style appropriate for a scientific journal article). These are generic content suggestions (only include aspects that are relevant to your animal):\n\nSelect an extinct animal*. Use the library and the Web to find out information about your animal. Get help from the librarians if you need it. Write about two pages of background on your animal. What did it look like? (You may include a photocopy of any published reconstructions; but it would be better if you draw the figures yourself). Where did it live? In what kind of environment did it live? What was the range of ambient temperatures in which it lived (day, night; winter, summer). What did it eat? What other sorts of animals and plants lived at the same time? Include anything that you find particularly interesting about the animal.\nFrom fossils described in the literature, estimate the body mass and body dimensions of your animal. Make a sketch of your animal and add the body dimensions (overall height, leg length, wing span, etc).\nWas your animal poikilothermic or homeothermic? Endothermic or ectothermic? What range of body temperatures could your animal tolerate? How did it deal with extreme heat or cold stress? If the animal was a thermoregulator, how did it regulate its body temperature? Did it have insulating fur, feathers or fat? Could it sweat or use other forms of evaporative cooling? Did it allow its tissues to become supercooled without freezing? Was it freeze tolerant? Did it use countercurrent heat exchangers? Did it go into torpor or hibernate?\nFor endotherms, calculate BMR (choose an appropriate interspecific scaling equation from Withers Table 4-5). From BMR, estimate RMR, AMR, MMR and DMR. What is the metabolic scope of your animal? Include a lot of detail in writing about the lifestyle of the animal and why you chose the values that you did to estimate DMR and MMR.\nFor ectotherms, choose an appropriate interspecific scaling equation from Withers Table 4-5 and the iterative method to calculate SMR for the animal when it is inactive at night (assume a Q\\(_{10}\\) of 2.5 for metabolic rate). How much higher is body temperature than air temperature during the night (T\\(_b\\)-T\\(_a\\))? Use the Q\\(_{10}\\) correction to calculate SMR at the higher ambient temperatures during the day (not yet iterative). Increase SMR by a factor of 1.5-3 to reflect active metabolic rate (AMR). Now use the iterative calculations to determine Tb-Ta, and the corresponding increase in MR. Estimate DMR for your animal. These are just suggestions, find something interesting about DMR to explore.\nEstimate values for the heat balance equation for your animal at rest. Use allometric equations to estimate minimum Hc, and CEWL+REWL to estimate minimum He. Then imagine some situations in which your animal might experience heat or cold stress, and use the heat equation to see whether it is able to maintain heat balance. Create a situation that would put your animal out of heat balance. How fast does the body temperature increase or decrease?\nIf your animal is an endotherm, how much energy per day could your animal save by hibernating with a lower body temperature (if reasonable for your animal; this is a hard question to answer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Note: Use standard scientific citation and reference formats throughout all of your papers.\n\n\n\nCite sources as (author(s), date) and include full references at the end of each design. For example: The earliest amphibians were largely aquatic, and are thought to have had internal gills (Coates and Clack, 1991).\nCoates, M. I. and Clack, J. A. 1991. Fish-like gills and breathing in the earliest known tetrapod. Nature, 352:234-236.\n\n\n[pdf] version of this sheet"

We will learn physiology and apply our skills to reconstructing the physiological systems of an extinct animal. The lab allows students to see physiology in action in live-animal experiments illustrating heart regulation, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and kidney function.\nThroughout the course we will develop:\n- Individual skills in finding and close reading of scientific literature, synthesis of information, presentation in oral and written forms.\n- Collaboration skills in discussion, brainstorming, project organization and management, and collaborative writing.\n- Practical skills in dissection, specimen preparation, troubleshooting instrumentation, data analysis, figure design.\nWe will cover metabolism and scaling, heat balance, the circulatory system, feeding and digetsion, neurons and signal propagation, sensory biology, muscles and motor control, biomechanics and locomotion, blood, ventilation and respiration, osmoregulation and excretion, hormonal control, reproduction, and the immune system."

In research, a lab notebook is more than a diary of your work, it is used to write your reports and papers, inspire future research, or even prove the development of ideas in court cases.\nFor this class, it is bound notebook used exclusively for recording information and notes pertinent to experiments performed in this lab. Your lab notebook will help you to do well on your lab reports, which are typed (i.e., mini scientific papers) that you turn in for grading. It is also a great place to take notes in lab lectures or discussion that may be helpful later."

This should be the general idea that is broad enough to cover all of the ideas in the lab (the “umbrella idea”).\nBullet-point the most relevant background in this experiment, and how it might connect to a hypothesis.\n\nIntroduce the physiological mechanisms under study\n\nStart from what we know about the topic, and connect to what we are trying to demonstrate or find out in the current experiment. Be sure to introduce any ideas that go into your hypothesis. In other words.\n\n\nA starting hypothesis (or hypotheses if there are multiple parts).\n(Later, as you think about writing an introduction for your lab report, try to foreshadow why the current experiment is important.)\n\nAn introduction just introduces the ideas (or touches upon them). Just enough so we can understand the hypothesis.\nYour TA will give you feedback during the prelab-check. We particularly want to make sure you have a strong hypothesis."

    "text": "Methods\nThe experiment should be reproducible by a scientist based on your methods. Include:\n\nType of subjects (species) and how many\nWhat measurements you collected\nTechniques. (e.g., Human heart rate (HR) was measured using a finger pulse transducer connected to a PowerLab Data Acquistion System). Note settings.\nExperimental details.\n\nMeasurements (what?, where?, recording for how long, how many times, etc.)\nDetails of controls (or baselines) and treatments\nOrder of experiments, etc.\nYou do not need to copy standard protocols. Simply refer to any published or standard protocols (i.e, from lab manual), but explain any customizations. Do explain what the standard protocols were used to measure.\n\nHow raw data are converted to physiological measurements\n\nFor example, “systolic pressure was obtained from the blood pressure waveform by taking peak-to-trough measurements of the largest peaks.”\nExample: “Heart rate was calculated using the cyclic measurements panel in LabChart softare to measure the time between pulse wave peaks (peak-to-peak measurements) divided by elapsed time.”\nExample: “Peripheral circulation volume was measured as the difference between maximum and minimum leg volume measurements (at baseline and after reducing venous return for 30sec, respectively).”\n\nAnalysis\n\nHow the data will be used to evaluate the hypotheses. In other words, what will we compare to know whether the hypothesis has any support? This usually involves how the treatments will be compared to controls or baseline and can foreshadow the figures presented in the results.\nFor example, “HR was compared before and during a simulated dive to assess diving bradycardia, and venous pooling …”"

This can be further analyzed at home with LabChart reader 8.0 software.\nIt is important to record things that go wrong as well as things that go right.\nWe will have in-lab discussions about how to analyze data and brainstorm what effective figures might look like. It is a great idea to sketch these ideas in your notebook.\n\nDuring lab, there should be time to collect the physiological parameters from your raw data, and to play with making figures or tables for your lab report."

Dig into the details of the results.\nNote any connections between your results and known physiological mechanisms. What have we learned or demonstrated?\nCould your results apply to anything else? End by broadening out.\nInclude any good ideas that come up during the lab session."
