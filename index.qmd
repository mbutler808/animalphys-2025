Zool430 at the University of Hawai ªi!

## What is this course?

This is an upper level class for people interested in learning comparative physiology  via original research projects.  We will learn physiology and apply our skills to reconstructing the physiological systems of an extinct animal. 
The lab allows students to see physiology in action in live-animal experiments illustrating heart regulation, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and kidney function.

Throughout the course we will develop:  
-  _Individual skills_ in finding and close reading of scientific literature, synthesis of information, presentation in oral and written forms.  
-  _Collaboration skills_ in discussion, brainstorming, project organization and management, and collaborative writing.   
-  _Practical skills_ in dissection, specimen preparation, troubleshooting instrumentation, data analysis, figure design.

We will cover metabolism and scaling, heat balance, the circulatory system, feeding and digetsion, neurons and signal propagation, sensory biology, muscles and motor control, biomechanics and locomotion, blood, ventilation and respiration, osmoregulation and excretion, hormonal control, reproduction, and the immune system. 


## Getting started

Please look over the [Syllabus](syllabus.qmd) and [Schedule](schedule.qmd) under **General Information**. Lectures and Lab materials are provided under the __Course Materials__ tab. 

__For the first day of lecture__, please prepare by reading the paper on modeling *Megalodon* [linked here](posts/2025-08-27-megalodon-model/index.qmd).

__For the first day of lab__, please prepare by reading the short paper on blood pressure measurement, watching the podcast, and looking over the instrumentation lab manual and protocol [linked here](labs/Lab1-heart-rate-and-data-analysis/Lab1.qmd).
